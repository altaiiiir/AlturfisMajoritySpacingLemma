# Alturfi's Majority Spacing Lemma

This repository contains a compiled LaTex PDF for the paper **"Alturfi's Majority Spacing Lemma: A Structural Insight into the Majority Element Problem"**. The paper introduces and formalizes a structural property of majority elements in arrays, providing an intuitive explanation for the correctness of majority-element algorithms like Boyer–Moore.

## Overview
The paper presents:
1. **Alturfi's Majority Spacing Lemma**: A structural property that states any majority element in an array must either appear consecutively at least once or occupy the last position.
2. **Proof of the Lemma**: A rigorous proof using a pigeonhole-style argument.
3. **Algorithmic Implications**: Applications to majority-element algorithms, including Boyer–Moore and streaming contexts.
4. **Educational Benefits**: How the lemma simplifies understanding and teaching of majority-element problems.

## Purpose
The goal of this work is to:
- Provide a novel structural insight into majority-element problems.
- Enhance intuition and teaching materials for algorithms like Boyer–Moore.
- Explore potential extensions to streaming and real-time data applications.

## Feedback
I am actively seeking feedback on the content, proof, and potential applications of the lemma. Please feel free to open an issue with comments or suggestions!
